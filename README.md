# Tuberculosis-Temporal-and-geographical-evolution
This project explores the temporal and geographical evolution of tuberculosis (TB) from 1990 to 2013, using data from the World Health Organization (WHOW). 
Interactive Tableau visualizations enable exploration at global, regional, and country levels with a particular focus on three indicators: TB incidence, TB deaths, and TB + HIV coinfection.

**Why this period**

The 1990–2013 window captures important global public-health transitions: the post-Cold War era of renewed international health initiatives, the scale-up of antiretroviral therapy for HIV in the 2000s (which affected TB dynamics), and the period leading up to the Sustainable Development Goals. Analyzing this period helps reveal how TB burden responded to evolving health systems, treatment access, and the HIV epidemic.

**Data overview**

- **Indicators included:** TB incidence (new and relapse cases per year), TB-attributed deaths, and TB cases among people living with HIV (coinfection).

- **Temporal coverage:** annual data from 1990 through 2013.

- **Geographical coverage:** global — countries grouped into WHO regions and income categories for comparative views.
